The following is an excerpt from an email by Professor Roger Sidje on
December 20, 2018:

    I am okay that you slice and dice Expokit any way you want for
    your purposes.

    [Y]ou can also release it (and your derivatives) in any license
    you want, including the BSD license you mentioned.

    This very permissive Expokit license also means that other
    versions of Expokit not derived from your copy remain free to be
    licensed any way too

The original Expokit license notice follows:

                              NOTICE

Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute EXPOKIT and its
supporting documentation for non-commercial purposes, is hereby
granted without fee, provided that this permission message and
copyright notice appear in all copies. Approval must be sought for
commercial purposes.

Neither the Institution (University of Queensland) nor the Authors
make any representations about the suitability of this software for
any purpose.  This software is provided ``as is'' without express or
implied warranty.

The work resulting from EXPOKIT has been published in ACM-Transactions 
on Mathematical Software, 24(1):130-156, 1998.

The bibtex record of the citation:

Certain elements of the current software may include inadequacies
that may be corrected at any time, as they are discovered. The Web 
always contains the latest updates.
