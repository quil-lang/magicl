# MAGICL

_Matrix Algebra proGrams In Common Lisp_ by [Rigetti Computing](http://www.rigetti.com). (nÃ©e FLAIL: _Finally, Linear Algebra In Lisp!_)

(**Note**: The high-level interface is experimental and subject to change.)

## Requirements

MAGICL has two main systems:

- `MAGICL/CORE`: This is pure Lisp code with no foreign
dependencies. This system establishes the API of the library nearly
completely..

- `MAGICL`: This is the core MAGICL with all extensions loaded.

The system `MAGICL/CORE` requires:

* SBCL (> 1.3.19) or CCL (>= 1.11) on AMD64
* quicklisp

The system `MAGICL`, on the other hand, requires several foreign
dependencies not shipped with MAGICL, like:

- libffi
- BLAS and LAPACK

Detailed instructions on how to install `libffi` and BLAS/LAPACK can
be found [here](doc/requirements.md).

Currently this library is SBCL- and CCL-only. The non-portable code is
in `with-array-pointers.lisp` and `magicl.lisp`.

## Installation

First ensure you have the necessary requirements installed, as
described in the previous section.

To install MAGICL, clone this repository into your Quicklisp's
`local-projects` folder. You can quickly check where this is by
running `sbcl` and evaluating `ql:*local-project-directories*`. Once
installed, confirm that MAGICL is working properly by running the
tests, as described in the next section.

## Lisp-Only vs Accelerated MAGICL

### Extensions

`MAGICL/CORE` by default only uses pure ANSI Common Lisp code. If you
wish to accelerate it or extend the functionality, you may load
*MAGICL extensions*. These extensions typically install new backends
to MAGICL functions. The available extensions are:

- `MAGICL/EXT-BLAS`: for BLAS functions
- `MAGICL/EXT-LAPACK`: for LAPACK functions
- `MAGICL/EXT-EXPOKIT`: for expokit (matrix `exp()`) functions

For backwards compatibility, `MAGICL` loads every extension under the
kitchen sink. **This may change in future versions of MAGICL!**

If you use extensions, you'll need the requisite C/Fortran
libraries. Expokit will automatically build for you, as its source is
included in the distribution of MAGICL.

### Backends

Accelerated functionality is installed with a notion called "backends". A
*backend* is a name of a group of functionality, typically denoted by
a symbol or keyword. The `:lisp` backend is the defualt one, and
several backends can be active all at once. Each extension above adds
a new backend. The current backends are:

- `:lisp`: Pure Lisp code
- `:blas`: BLAS-backed code
- `:lapack`: LAPACK-backed code
- `:expokit`: expokit-backed code

In most cases, one does not need to concern themselves with backends;
MAGICL functionality should "just work" and dispatch to the
appropriate backend. However, the programmer always has control, even
dynamically in the program, of which backends should be used at a
given time with the `magicl.backends:with-backends` macro. For instance,

```
(magicl.backends:with-backends (:blas :lisp)
  ;; ... code ...
  )
```

says that the code should be executed, always preferring
`:blas`-accelerated functions, and using `:lisp`-implemented functions
as a fall-back.

```
(magicl.backends:with-backends (:lisp)
  ;; ... code ...
  )
```

says to *only* use `:lisp`-implemented functions, even if other
backends are loaded.


The active backends can be found with the function
`magicl.backends:active-backends`, which lists the backends to use in
priority order.

One can be even finer-grained than `with-backends`. Given a function
`f` which has many backend implementations, one can get a specific
implementation by using the function:

```
(magicl.backends:backend-implementation 'f :backend-name)
```

For instance

```
(magicl.backends:backend-implementation 'magicl:csd :lapack)
```

will give the implementation of the cosine-sine decomposition function
in LAPACK. This can be called in exactly the same way `magicl:csd` can
be called.

In `backend-implementation`, if both the function name and the backend
name are (quoted) constants, this will be looked up at compile-time,
which is useful for writing efficient code that does not dispatch. But
note that by doing this, `with-backends` will not be respected.

## Testing MAGICL

You can run the MAGICL tests from your Lisp REPL with:

```
(asdf:test-system :magicl)
```

You currently need all of the extensions working for the tests to run.

## High-level Interface

See the [high-level doc](doc/high-level.md) for an extensive discussion
and comparison of MAGICL functions with those of MATLAB and NumPy.

## Developer's Guide: How to Add New Functions

See the [developer how-to](doc/dev-how-to.md) to understand how to add
new functionality to MAGICL.

## Showing Available Functions

Some distributions of a library don't actually provide all of the
functions of the reference BLAS and LAPACK. One can look at a summary
of available and unavailable functions with the function
`magicl:print-availability-report`. By default, it will show all
functions and their availability. There are three arguments to
fine-tune this behavior:

1. Key `:show-available <boolean>` (default `t`): show available
functions

2. Key `:show-unavailable <boolean>` (default `t`): show unavailable
functions

3. Key `:search <string>`: only show functions which have `<string>`
as a substring. **This argument takes into account the previous two
arguments.**

For example, we can look for all available functions which might
relate to `svd` by doing the following:

```
CL-USER> (magicl:print-availability-report :search "svd" :show-unavailable nil)

## Generating BLAS and LAPACK Bindings

This library takes the approach of automatically generating the
bindings to BLAS, LAPACK, and Expokit without relying on any special
tools.

In order to generate the bindings, you will need to download the
Fortran 90 source tarballs for
[BLAS/LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) and
[Expokit](https://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/download.html).  Once
downloaded, extract the tarballs into a directory and re-generate the
bindings with the following commands:

```
(ql:quickload :magicl-gen)
(in-package :magicl.generate-interface)
(generate-blas-files #P"/path/to/lapack-3.7.1/")
(generate-lapack-files* #P"/path/to/lapack-3.7.1/")
(generate-expokit-files #P"/path/to/expokit/")
```

Currently this will write to the source distribution directory of
MAGICL, namely the files `blas-cffi.lisp`, `lapack*-cffi.lisp`, and
`expokit-cffi.lisp`.

## History and Credits

MAGICL development started at Rigetti Computing by Robert Smith and
Joe Lin in 2017.

[CL-BLAPACK](https://github.com/blindglobe/cl-blapack) is a library
developed by Ryan Rifkin and Evan Monroig. Rigetti Computing created a
fork of this library and renamed it MAGICL, and made significant
changes that departed from the original design, including:

* Fixing several bugs in the Fortran parsing to make it work with the
latest reference BLAS and LAPACK, leading to significant refactoring.

* Adding support for matrix exponentiation with Expokit.

* Adding support for loading various BLAS and LAPACK implementations.

* Removing the use of the FNV library in favor of native Lisp arrays.

* Adding a high-level interface to various functions.

* Adding function availability reporting.

The most important common design decision between CL-BLAPACK and
MAGICL is allowing direct access to the Fortran library functions by
way of automatically generated Lisp bindings from the reference
sources.
